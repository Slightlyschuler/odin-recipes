    <p>This warm, sweet cinnamon roll casserole is a great twist on French toast, kind of like a French toast casserole and custard mixed. We have it every Christmas morning. Serve with whipped cream and either blackberry or strawberry preserves.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 stick butter, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) loaf cinnamon swirl bread</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Directions:</h2>

        <li>
            Butter 6 slices of cinnamon swirl bread; place butter-side down into a casserole dish. Butter 6 more slices of bread and place butter-side down on top of other slices.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Mix milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl and pour over bread. Let sit for 8 hours to overnight.

            Place casserole dish inside a larger pan; pour water into the outside pan, making sure not to get water into the casserole.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, about 50 minutes.
