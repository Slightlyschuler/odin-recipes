    <p>I created this recipe one morning for something unique and different for my family. Since we love the taste of brown sugar and cinnamon, this recipe combines the flavors of cinnamon rolls, egg casseroles, and French toast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 can (10 oz) reduced fat crescent rolls</li>

        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 (3 oz) package Neufchatal cheese</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Directions:</h2>
    <ol>

            Pull crescent roll dough out of the can; slice dough into 1/2-inch pieces. Arrange over the bottom of the baking dish. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon on top. Drop teaspoonfuls of the Neufchatel cheese on top.
